## app for annotating animal vocalizations and other sounds

![graphical user interface showing spectrogram of birdsong, amplitude waveform beneath it, and segments based on threshold crossings of amplitude that are annotated with text labels](./doc/images/annotation-example.png)

## about
goals:
- immediate:
  + open-source
  + works with multiple formats for annotating vocalizations (using https://github.com/NickleDave/crowsetta)
  + lightweight: think atom/sublime, not PyCharm/vscode
  + as configurable as possible: key bindings, color schemes for spectrograms
- longer term:
  + plug-in system
  + hackable -- Napari-like
  + web app
